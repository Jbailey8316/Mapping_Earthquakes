# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect data on earthquakes and to visually showcase the differences in magnitude.

## Resources
* VS Studio
* Leaflet 1.7.1
* JavaScript 
* Mapbox
* D3

## Results
By using a combination of Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Leaflet along with other resources like a Mapbox API; I was able to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data by magnitude and location over the past 7 days.

Additional features that were added to this project include indivual pop ups for each earthquake showcasing the magnitude and location data retrieved using D3.  Along with multiple map options. (Streets, Satellite, and Dark)
